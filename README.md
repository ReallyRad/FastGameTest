# MadboxTest

This is a test to try and make a basic game as fast as possible. It is based on the mobile game Fun race 3D. It took around 4h30 to do, including this readme.
The game is controlled using the spacebar as the sole input mechanism

## Difficulties
I tried to add ragdoll physics to the character upon impact with the wrecking balls, but this would take much more time to configure properly as it conflicts with the character animator.

## Possible improvements
As the basic mechanic for the game is there, It should be really easy to add more obstacles that are based on simple movements of colliding geometry.
Right now the character is moving following the x axis, some sort of curve following mechanism would have to be added in order to make level movement more intesting.

## To take it further
More eye catching Art assets, more animations, particle effects, sound effects, unpredictable level design. With such a simple game mechanic I think to keep it interesting one should focus on designing clever puzzles, and also some kind of reward/competition system.
For instance the original game simulates multiplayer with bots, which creates a sense of competition.

## Comments
The game mechanics is too simple to be really interesting and requires a lot of level design or satisfying and varied animations to keep it interesting.
